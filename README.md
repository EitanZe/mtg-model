# MTG Model

_Project Objective:_ What are you trying to model? Include a brief description that would give someone unfamiliar with the topic a basic understanding of your goal.
We use Forge to model a simplified version of the trading card game Magic: The Gathering, a complex turn-based game where the turns subdivide into different possible actions and phases. The complete rulebook pdf is attached in this repo for reference. The scale of possibilities for a game of Magic is very wide-reaching, so we tried to constrain for this assignment by vastly simplifying it to only contain a few different types of cards and actions. Our eventual goal, when expanding this model for the final project, is to be able to model and explore potential unexpected game possibilities without

Model Design and Visualization: Give an overview of your model design choices, what checks or run statements you wrote, and what we should expect to see from an instance produced by the Sterling visualizer. How should we look at and interpret an instance created by your spec? Did you create a custom visualization, or did you use the default?

Signatures and Predicates: At a high level, what do each of your sigs and preds represent in the context of the model? Justify the purpose for their existence and how they fit together.

Testing: What tests did you write to test your model itself? What tests did you write to verify properties about your domain area? Feel free to give a high-level overview of this.

Documentation: Make sure your model and test files are well-documented. This will help in understanding the structure and logic of your project.
